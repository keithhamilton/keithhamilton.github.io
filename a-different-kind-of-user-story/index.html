    <div class="post-single-content"><div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>Early in my days on the design team I took an online certification course in interaction design. I wasn't deluded that taking such a course would make me an interaction designer, but I figured it couldn't hurt to formalize some of the skills I'd learnt on the job.</p>
<p>At one point along the course we had to write a user journey to use as a map against a feature set for some fictitious product. I began by writing a persona to which I thought "I'll map the journey." After writing a few traits about my person, I got bored, and decided to throw my work away.</p>
<p>I began anew with a much more interesting path. A much <em>darker</em> one.</p>
<p>User journeys and personas often reinforce what we expect, or at least desire, to happen.</p>
<p>When we write user stories they often speak to the features we want to see, and are reverse-engineered to sound like they belong to an actual, live person out in the ether who wants our product.</p>
<p>When we write personas, we tend to craft the ideal person for our product, as opposed to the last person we'd ever expect to use our product. This is a problem for two reasons. Firstly, we don't know everyoneâ€”so even our perfect persona will be a fictitious human with fictitious needs. Secondly, we don't know who will use our product in the end, so writing personas based on ideal candidates is akin to tying a hand behind one's back before entering a typing contest.</p>
<p>So, I decided to write a classically weird persona whom I would genuinely feel sorry for, were he real. Side note, someone like this certainly exists somewhere. His plight is that he is a virtually single dad (his wife, Hildy works nights) who struggles to pick his kids up from school, get to the store, make dinner, and have them into bed in a reasonable timeframe. He's also terribly alcoholic.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further introduction, I present to you Walter McWaltface.</p>
